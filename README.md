I'm a Vtuber who likes to code, so I've been learning how to do it! Currently I know:
- Golang
- Python
- PhP

I am interested in a lot of different languages like c, c++, c#, js, typescript and so on!
I hope to one day learn a lot about them!

If you are a potential hire looking through my profile, I am honoured. I ask that you respect that I do not wish my real name to be revealed online.

## About me:
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://x.com/KyouKyuubi/header_photo) is usually the best place to reach me (when the bots decide to leave me alone)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about about anything! I'm happy to help
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I easily get excited about things and when I do, I start shaking.
